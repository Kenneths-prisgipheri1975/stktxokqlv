OMG, just walked out of Black Bag and my mind is a big, messy rainbow swamp right now. You know when you get kinda lost in a  , and your popcorn ends up everywhere but your mouth? Yeah, that. theater was packed, noisy too, like a zoo of emotions all around.

> So here's this scene, right, where that guy Leon — or was it Louis? — he's like sprinting through this golden alley full of glowing trash bags. And I'm like, Is this a metaphor for my morning hair routine? Everything felt crunchy and tactile, voices of people next to me blending with the dialogue, like a symphony of life just happening.

The plot was like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a cat try to catch a laser pointer. Jumping everywhere, but weirdly satisfying. I mean, we got neon cars soaring through the sky, which reminded me of the last time I tried doing a smoky eye look with a shaky brush, chaos... beautiful chaos.

This aching back situation I got from sitting all through that twisty mess of a climax, ugh. But dang, the color palette was like visiting a circus in space while tripping on pistachio ice cream visions. So lush. 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   if you wanna 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the chaos unfurl at your pace, but I'd recommend the big screen first.

Just realized I left my jacket on the seat... typical me. At least I didn't drop my phone in the popcorn again. Honestly, this 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 is like a haircut gone wrong but you walk out a new person anyway. Leon's eyes had that shimmer — kinda like highlighter on a perfect cheekbone vs me trying not to spill my drink every 5 mins, haha.

Movie moments flashback into my head like random flash mobs while typing this, my mind's a disco ball right now. It felt like someone drizzled hot sauce all over the plot and forgot to tell me it was happening, but in a good way? Dunno, my brain feels like jelly. 🌀
